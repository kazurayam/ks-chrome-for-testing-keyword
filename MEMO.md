Have a look at the following page

- [kazurayam/ks-chrome-for-testing-support trafic](https://github.com/kazurayam/ks-chrome-for-testing-support/graphs/traffic)

Here you can see how many unique visitors visited this project.

As of 27th Feb 2024, it had 32 unique visitors. This is a fact. I think that they are "early adaptors".

The Wikipedia page ["Technology adaption life cycle"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_adoption_life_cycle) that the early adaptors occupies 13.5% of the total users.

So I would do a reverse inference. Provided that 32 is the 13.5% of the total, then the total could be (32 * 100) / 13.5 = 237.

I would presume that the number of Katalon Studio user would be 237 or around. Not as many as 60,000.

Interesting.
