Have a look at the following page

- [kazurayam/ks-chrome-for-testing-support trafic](https://github.com/kazurayam/ks-chrome-for-testing-support/graphs/traffic)

Here you can see how many unique visitors visited this project. As of 27th Feb 2024, it had 32 unique visitors. This is a fact.

Now I would play on this figure. I think that they are "early adaptors". The Wikipedia page ["Technology adaption life cycle"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_adoption_life_cycle) tells me that the early adaptors occupies 13.5% of the total number of users.

I would like to do a statistic estimation. Provided that 32 is the 13.5% of the total, then the total could be (32 * 100) / 13.5 = 237.

So I would presume that the number of active and serious Katalon Studio user would be 237 or around. Not so small, but not many as [60,000](https://forum.katalon.com/t/we-reached-60-000-members-celebrate-the-occasion-with-us/116988).

Interesting.
